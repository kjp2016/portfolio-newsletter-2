Dear Valued Client,

**Market Update: May 9 – May 16, 2025**

I hope this message finds you well. As we progress through the second quarter, I wanted to share a concise update on recent market developments and how they may relate to your portfolio. The past week has been marked by notable progress in trade relations, steady economic indicators, and selective sector performances that are shaping investor sentiment. Here’s a brief overview:

### Market Overview

- **Market Performance:** The S&amp;P 500 extended its winning streak with a 0.4% gain on May 15, closing near record highs at 5,916.93. The Dow Jones increased 0.6%, while the Nasdaq experienced a slight 0.2% dip, reflecting mixed performances across sectors.
  
- **Trade Developments:** A breakthrough in U.S.-China trade relations saw tariffs significantly reduced for 90 days, boosting global investor confidence and lifting markets worldwide. This easing of tensions supports growth prospects and reduces uncertainty.

- **Inflation and Fed Outlook:** April’s Consumer Price Index eased slightly to 2.3%, relieving some inflation concerns and giving the Federal Reserve more flexibility on interest rate decisions. Market expectations have shifted, now anticipating two rate cuts by year-end.

- **Sector Highlights:** Defensive sectors, particularly Utilities, led gains as investors balanced optimism with caution. Technology stocks rebounded strongly, driven by artificial intelligence advancements and corporate investments, while energy prices stabilized, providing opportunities amid steady demand.

- **Geopolitical and Economic Signals:** Significant U.S. investment commitments from Gulf states and ongoing international cooperation underscore positive global economic trends. Meanwhile, upcoming economic data releases, including producer prices and retail sales, will offer further insights into market direction.

### Portfolio Highlights

- **Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN):** Amazon’s stock has risen nearly 8% this month, buoyed by a $14 billion AI investment aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. With a 17% increase in Amazon Web Services revenue, the company is well-positioned for growth, despite a cautious revenue forecast for the next quarter.

- **Broadcom Inc. (AVGO):** Broadcom shares surged almost 18%, reflecting the successful $69 billion acquisition of VMware and strategic partnerships with Google Cloud. These moves enhance Broadcom’s cloud and AI portfolio, supporting robust revenue growth prospects.

- **Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY):** Shares declined about 7.7% following a first-quarter loss impacted by acquisition-related charges and a lowered earnings forecast. However, ongoing cost-saving initiatives targeting $1.5 billion in savings by 2025 may improve financial stability moving forward.

- **Calamos Timpani Small Cap Growth I (CTSIX):** The fund gained nearly 9%, benefiting from a rebound in small-cap stocks after a prolonged bear market. Its focus on fundamentally strong growth companies positions it well to capture momentum in this segment.

- **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):** NVIDIA’s stock soared over 20%, supported by record quarterly revenues and expansion plans in China’s AI chip market. While geopolitical risks remain, the company’s leadership in AI technology continues to drive investor enthusiasm.

### Looking Ahead

The easing of trade tensions and moderated inflation create a constructive backdrop for markets, though vigilance remains essential given ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties. We continue to emphasize diversification, focusing on sectors positioned for sustainable growth, including technology and energy, while maintaining prudent exposure to defensive areas.
